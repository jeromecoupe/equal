Luc has been a lawyer at the Brussels Bar for 30 years and has experience across many disciplines in various areas of administrative law. In the last few years, Luc has mainly focused on advising public and private stakeholders on energy and environmental matters. One of the major challenges of our times is related to sharing common public goods. Demographic growth and the monopoly of scarce resources place huge pressure on ecosystems, which Luc is proud to defend and help protect.
