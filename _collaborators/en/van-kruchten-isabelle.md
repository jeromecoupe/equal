Isabelle van Kruchten focuses the main part of her practice on all aspects of public procurement (contracting, performance, litigation and criminal matters). In this capacity she assists both public authorities and private companies. She publishes and regularly participates in seminars on these subjects. This has also enabled her to develop expertise in subsidies (national and European), in general construction law and in health law.
